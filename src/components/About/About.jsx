      <p>
        Hello! 👋🏻 I am Carolina, I initially studied business administration and marketing.
        I am a person who seeks professional and personal growth, focused on teamwork.
        Being a creative person I have focused on the frontend and UX/UI area, because I firmly believe that solutions can be solved efficiently where design, user experience and functionality are important parts in the development of any web application.
        I consider that my background in marketing and business administration allows me to bring to organizations a comprehensive knowledge in terms of production processes, as well as experience in the area of customer service both internal and external, business creation, project development, management, good interpersonal relationships.
